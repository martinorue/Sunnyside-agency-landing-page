## Overview

This is my first project using SASS and I made a huge effort in order to follow the good practices, such using @forward and @use instead of @import (link a la doc.)



### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

This is my first project using Sass.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass
**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

- Sass
 - The use of @use and @forward instead of @import (deprecated)
- How to make an accessible modal menu hamburger style
- I wasted a lot of time trying to adjust the background image for the header. Then I realized I was using the desktop image instead of the mobile one. The lesson to be learned is to always make sure you are using the right image and don't get stuck on a problem for hours, just move on with the rest.

### Questions

- When should I use background-image and when should I use <img>?
- Why is it necessary to have @use'../base/' as * in the _header.scss and in the main.scss?

### Continued development

ARIA
